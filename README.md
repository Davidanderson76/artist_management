# artist_management
Angular application with Spring Boot backend to track and manage artists on a roster

Learning Angular as I go with this project, I am familiar and very comfortable with React, so I wanted to challenge myself to learn more.

after some trouble shoouting and learning the file system of angular I have this simple layout now pulling data from my java backend and displaying it for my name on the card. Other cards are place holders that I found on https://www.bootdey.com/snippets/view/bs4-contact-cards.
